5.	What happens if you click "Close & Apply" in Power Query?

✍️ Advanced Transformations and M-code
11.	Write custom M-code to add a column calculating TotalSpent = Quantity * Price:
Table.AddColumn(PreviousStep, "TotalSpent", each [Quantity] * [Price])
12.	Group the table by CustID to show total spending per customer:
•	Go to Home → Group By
o	Group by: CustID
o	New column name: TotalSpending
o	Operation: Sum
o	Column: TotalSpent
13.	Fix inconsistent date formats in OrderDate:
•	Convert OrderDate to Date type:
o	Select column → Transform → Data Type → Date
o	Power Query will auto-parse if format is valid.
14.	Create a conditional column: Label orders as "High Value" if Price > 100:
•	Go to Add Column → Conditional Column
o	If Price > 100 then "High Value" else "Normal"
15.	Optimize the query to reduce refresh time (e.g., remove unused columns early):
•	Remove unneeded columns immediately after loading data using Remove Columns.
•	Avoid steps like sorting or grouping before filtering.
•	Minimize use of custom columns that require heavy calculations.
