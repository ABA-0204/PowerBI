1. List three data sources Power BI can connect to.
Excel, csv

SQL Server Database

Web API (JSON or XML feeds)

2. What is the first step to import data into Power BI Desktop?
 "Home" > "Get Data" and select your desired data source (e.g., Excel, CSV, SQL, etc.).

3. How do you refresh imported data in Power BI?
  “Home” > “Refresh” or right-click on a dataset in the Fields pane and select “Refresh Data”.

4. What file formats can Power BI import directly? (Name two.)
.csv (Comma-Separated Values)

.xlsx (Excel Workbook)

5. What does the "Navigator" window show after selecting a data source?
It displays the tables, sheets, or data objects available in the selected source, allowing you to preview and choose what to load.

6. Import Sales_Data.csv and load only the "Product" and "Price" columns.
 Home > Get Data > Text/CSV

Select Sales_Data.csv

In the Navigator, click "Transform Data"

In Power Query, select only the "Product" and "Price" columns

Click "Close & Load"

7. How would you change OrderDate to a date format during import?
In Power Query Editor:
Select the OrderDate column → click Data Type icon → choose Date

8. What is the difference between "Load" and "Transform Data" in the import dialog?
Load: Imports the data as-is into Power BI

Transform Data: Opens Power Query to clean or modify the data before loading

9. Why might you see an error when connecting to a SQL database? (Name one reason.)
Incorrect login credentials or lack of database permissions

10. How do you replace a data source after importing it?
Go to Home > Transform Data > Data Source Settings, select the source, click Change Source, and update the file path or server info.

11. Write the M-code to import only rows where Quantity > 1.

12. How would you change the data source if Sales_Data.csv changed?
Go to Transform Data > Data Source Settings, click Change Source, and select the new or updated file.

13. Troubleshoot: Your CSV import fails due to a "mixed data type" error—how do you fix it?
In Power Query, explicitly set a consistent data type for the affected column using Transform > Data Type, or replace errors with nulls if needed.

14. Connect to a live SQL database with parameters (e.g., filter by year).
Go to Home > Get Data > SQL Server

Enter server/database name

Click Advanced options, enter SQL query with parameter (e.g., SELECT * FROM Sales WHERE YEAR(OrderDate) = @Year)

Define parameter in Power Query: Manage Parameters

Bind the parameter to the query using M-code

15. How would you automate data imports using Power BI and Power Automate?
